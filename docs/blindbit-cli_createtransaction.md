## blindbit-cli createtransaction

Construct a transaction

### Synopsis

This command can be used to create a transaction sending to exactly one address.
Use `createtransactionmany` if you want to send to several recipients.
By default this will output the raw transaction hex.
Setting the `--broadcast` flag will automatically broadcast the transaction.
Then the command will output the txid of the created transaction.
